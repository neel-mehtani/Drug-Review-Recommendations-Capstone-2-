I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free.

All that is history.  If you\\'re ready to stop, there\\'s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.

Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I\\'m sure it would not have been safe.

It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don\\'t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.

I normally get every side effect going and dread taking new medication in any form especially after an horrific experience with Ciorofloxacin but the only side effect I experienced with this was itchy ankles and feet on day two but that didn\\'t last into third day so I would class this as a minor side effect and insignificant.

After 2 weeks I had some breakthrough pain, so my Dr increased my dosage to 50mg and I\\'m still on that dosage today. For the first full year I was on this I never had pain and felt \\'cured\\'.

I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It\\'s a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted. My libido is markedly lower but I wonder if that is perhaps an effect of not being hypo manic. I take 20 mg for anxiety.\"',\n",

The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework.

I went to the ER and when I finally got in they put me on an IV to hydrate me. They then added Imitrex to the bag and I soon started feeling side effects. My head felt like I was going to pass out.

I feel like I only referred to enlongated periods of sleep because of depression, and events surrounding certain time frames hence thoughts, and reactions.\\r\\rAbilify (aripiprazole) My instant reaction from this drug is concern for my well-being.  I am nervous because I am one of the people taking this drug till the stars fade, every day to my last.  My doctors all seem to say the same thing, and that is, &quot;This medication is working for you&quot;.  I do blood tests when I go into the Hospital freqently, and they are not finding anything off the charts and everything is always normal with my vitals. \\r\\rMy thought is, how do they consider this medication works for me?  Because I am not showing side effects?  Because I am accepting?  I feel I have to hold patience, my own value, what I care about around me to help better myself mentally and my virtue.

No serious side effects. I must add before going on methotrexate, you should start eating healthier and detox the body the best you can for a month prior to going on methotrexate. If you don\\'t you are doing more harm than good because your immune system is going to sleep mode and if you got a load of junk and bad bacteria left they will just take over.\"',\n",

Our first pregnancy was planned and conceived first week of trying. This time has been much harder and very trying. My specialist recommended either clomid or straight to IVF.

I definitely know when I ovulated whilst taking clomid it was very obvious. Just finished round 3 100mg. Also had side effects on clomid such as hot flushes, mood swings and dizziness. Very emotional this time round. Fingers crossed.\"',\n",

I did find that taking it with milk really helps keep it to a minimum and in some cases didnt have nausea at all. Good luck to others on their journey!!\"',\n",
       " '\"Works great! Quiets a hacking cough, no matter how bad. Works the best &amp; when other products don\\'t work. Does cause drowsiness though but that\\'s not bad if it\\'s night time or you\\'re convalescing at home anyway from being sick. Great stuff!\"',\n",
       " '\"I have taken Inderal and Inderal LA for the past 30 years with very few side effects. It helps both my arrhythmia and my high blood pressure. I felt slightly weaker and more tired in the beginning, but now I just feel normal. I have been able to live a relatively normal life and have always been able to do whatever physical activity I needed to do.\"',\n",
       " '\"This saved my life. I am bipolar and take a dozen medicines, the dentist told me dry mouth like mine would cause permanent damage and tooth lose.  I bugged and bugged doctors until they prescribed Evoxac.  I went to my next dental check up and the dentist wanted the name of the drug.  Sure sometimes I drool in my sleep but I think I will go to my grave with the choppers GOD gave me and I thank him every single day for the person who invented Evoxac.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am beginning my fourth week on 20mg Fluoxetine taken each morning. I am recovering from a long term abusive relationship with a Narcissist. I have a head injury that predisposes me to fatigue.  I asked the doctor to help me with my energy levels. I did not admit it but the underlying feeling I had was that \\'everything was too much\\' and \\'nothing matters anyway\\'. But nobody would have guessed how hopeless I had become. And had been for at least 10 years. Initially I experienced all of the symptoms people warn about in the first few weeks. Insomnia and occassional extreme anxiety were the worst. Now I feel enthused about taking things one at a time and am enjoying the process. I have begun to sleep normally again. So far, so good.\"',\n",
       " '\"I had read a lot of negative reviews about Moviprep and was terrified of the stuff. In reality it was straight-forward to use, fairly palatable (better than soluble aspirin) and the results were not as unpleasant as my chronic IBS symptoms. \\r\\r\\r\\rI recommend mixing the solution with a cordial (ginger worked well) and drinking through a straw. Do not take large mouthfuls of it.\\r\\r\\r\\rThe first dose might take between 3-4 hours to take effect. Don\\'t worry - it will!\\r\\r\\r\\rJust make sure you take the sedation for your procedure. I did not and it was incredibly painful. Curiously, for a few weeks after the Moviprep and colonoscopy I experienced no IBS symptoms - it has been 6 weeks now and they\\'ve returned, unfortunately.\"',\n",
       " '\"Scared to death of taking it but broke tabs in half to 5mg in order to increase dose slowly. I have developed a bit of chronic tooth pain so taking it for pain. \\r\\r\\r\\rTook it at 7 pm and felt mildly sedated by 11pm. Actually didn\\'t sleep well but I think I was on high alert for the side effects which didn\\'t happen. A bit groggy in morning but nothing special that I can\\'t deal with. I think the way to go is to build up if you are scared of meds like me. \\r\\r\\r\\rI wrote this to encourage others to try the medicine because I am as scared as anyone to take drugs like this. \\r\\rI\"',\n",
       " '\"I take 80 mg of Geodon in the evening for Bipolar I with psychotic features.  It really helps to cut down the visual and auditory hallucinations though it sometimes makes me pretty tired in the morning. Sometimes I have a hard time driving first thing in the morning. It is worth it to straighten out my mind.\"',\n",
       " '\"I was bleeding heavily for 3 months straight. I would be off my period a week then 3 more months of bleeding. This went on over a year while I tried just about every other type of bc pill. Also extreme nausea causing bad weight loss and severe abdominal pain. On this pill my period lasts 5 days once a month and is much lighter. Cramps are much better. Nausea was worse at first but went away after about a week. No crazy mood swings. I\\'m back up to a healthy weight. The only bad thing is it made me exhausted, especially when I first started taking it. I would literally sleep 15 hours a day if off work. Wouldn\\'t even get up to eat. It has eased up a lot but still not back to normal energy.\"',\n",
       " '\"Had my gallbladder removed and they gave me morphine which didn\\'t really help much but then I ended up with a bile leak due to complications and they put me on dilaudid and every ounce of pain vanished seconds after it was put into my iv.  It made me really sleepy but not nauseous at all. Very addictive but works amazing to relieve extreme pain.\"',\n",
       " '\"This is the first ADD medication I have tried. In May started at 25mg 1x before bed and worked my way up to 80mg over a month. Initially, I had horrible headaches in the PM, so my Dr told me to take it in the AM; this made them disappear. I started a new research job in June and Strattera worked WONDERS helping me multitask as I moved from floor to floor. That being said, I felt like I lost my creativity, and it became difficult to hold a conversation with new coworkers/friends; I didn\\'t feel myself. I stopped the meds in Aug to form better relationships as I adjusted to a new place. I just started at 80mg today and that was a mistake. Dizziness, chills, racing heart. It feels like taking Sudafed. Do not start this medication suddenly!\"',\n",
       " '\"I like Implanon for the most part. I have been on it for about a year and a half. I have gained about 5 lbs or so and I continue to have periods. They last for about 8 to 10 days but they are light and I get them every couple of months. I have noticed that my breasts are very tender and I haven\\'t seen others talk about that. Anyone else have that problem?\"',\n",
       " '\"My boyfriend passed away...very unexpectantly.We had a wonderful, beautiful relationship...I simply adored him and overnight he\\'s gone. The next day my little brother had open heart surgery, my sister passed away last March after living and taking care of my father with dementia, my mother passed away after a 3 year long battle with cancer. I wanted to stay in bed all day curled up in the fetal position and pray that death would take me just so the pain would stop. But I didn\\'t have that luxury...someone had to pay the bills. I hated to go out in public because I never knew what would trigger a crying jag...I had a true sense of hopelessness. 75 mgs of Effexor saved my life. I\\'m happy again and laughing and going out and celebrating my life.\"',\n",
       " '\"I just started my 3rd week of active pills yesterday and so far so good. Before Aviane, I was on the Depo shot for a little over 2 years and I had so many problems and was miserable. So far, I\\'ve had nothing serious. A little bit of breast tenderness, few cramps. My sex drive has definitely increased from what it used to be. I take my pill at night but haven\\'t really had an nausea. Going on my 3rd week, I sort of feel like PMS symptoms but it could also be stress. Hard to tell. Overall, I\\'m happy with this pill.\"',\n",
       " '\"I think belviq pretty much saved my life! I had always been overweight all my life from about 8 years old. As an adult I had always maintained a  weight of around 200 lbs. However at 41 I was diagnosed with lymphangiomatosis and had to have a complete hysterectomy , gall bladder and appendix removal. I soon began gaining approximately 10 pounds a month post surgery and was soon at 258 at my highest. My doctor prescribed belviq on December 5th 2014. The first week I lost 7 lbs and by mid January I had lost 20 lbs. Now in June 2017 I weigh 180 lbs and feel fabulous!!! It wasn\\'t a quick fix but it worked and I stopped taking it in February and have maintained my weight . I recommend belviq to anyone ready to commit to a lifestyle change!\"',\n",

No random breakouts on my face and no weight gain from it. Definitely the best option if taking a pill is hard for someone. I never could remember to take my pill, this was the best option. The insertion was much better than I thought and it\\'s been great ever since.\"',\n",

Also, for those getting the nodules at the injection site, put an ice pack on the site for about 15 minutes and you will probably not get a knot. Works wonders for me.\"',\n",

Start weight was 188lb down to 172lb I had higher expectations for this drug.. but so far no other drug over counters have worked thats why I turned to this drug.. the last week or two I have found my self eating unhealthy again and having cravings - I am hoping this is only bc I started my monthly.. I would recommend this drug if all else has failed. The side affects for this drug sucks at first but hang in there they will fade.\"',\n",
